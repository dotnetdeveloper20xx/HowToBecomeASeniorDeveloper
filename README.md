## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design software. OOP helps developers create modular, maintainable, and reusable code. C# is a powerful OOP language that provides four core principles of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Polymorphism**
4. **Abstraction**

This guide will cover each of these principles in detail, starting from the basics and advancing to complex concepts. We will also cover best practices, what to watch out for, and potential interview questions.

---

## Chapter 1: Encapsulation

### What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (fields) and methods (functions) together in a single unit (class). It restricts access to the internal details of a class and protects data integrity.

### Key Concepts

* Private Fields
* Public Methods
* Properties (Getters and Setters)
* Access Modifiers (private, public, protected, internal)

### Code Example

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field (Encapsulated)

    // Public Method (Controlled Access)
    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    // Public Method (Controlled Access)
    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }

    // Public Property (Encapsulated)
    public decimal Balance
    {
        get { return balance; }
    }
}
```

### Why Use Encapsulation?

* Protects data integrity.
* Limits access to sensitive data.
* Allows controlled access through methods or properties.

### Best Practices

* Always keep fields private.
* Use properties (getters/setters) for controlled access.
* Use access modifiers appropriately (private, protected, public).

### Interview Questions

1. What is Encapsulation?
2. How do you enforce Encapsulation in C#?
3. Can Encapsulation be broken? How?

---

## Chapter 2: Inheritance

### What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (derived class) inherits the properties and methods of an existing class (base class).

### Key Concepts

* Base Class
* Derived Class
* "is-a" relationship
* Method Overriding
* Protected Access Modifier

### Code Example

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal // Inheriting from Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
}
```

### Why Use Inheritance?

* Promotes code reusability.
* Establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

### Best Practices

* Use inheritance only for "is-a" relationships.
* Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies.
* Prefer composition over inheritance where applicable.

### Interview Questions

1. What is Inheritance?
2. What is the difference between inheritance and composition?
3. How can you prevent a class from being inherited?

---

## Chapter 3: Polymorphism

### What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means "many forms." In C#, it allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object they are acting on.

### Key Concepts

* Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)
* Method Overriding (Run-Time Polymorphism)
* Virtual, Override, and New Keywords

### Code Example

```csharp
public class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}
```

### Why Use Polymorphism?

* Supports flexibility and extensibility.
* Allows for code that can work with objects of different types.

### Best Practices

* Use polymorphism for method customization.
* Prefer interfaces over base class polymorphism when applicable.

### Interview Questions

1. What is Polymorphism?
2. What is the difference between Overloading and Overriding?
3. Can you override a private method in C#?

---

## Chapter 4: Abstraction

### What is Abstraction?

Abstraction means hiding the complexity and only exposing the essential details to the user.

### Key Concepts

* Abstract Classes
* Interfaces
* Abstract Methods

### Code Example

```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public abstract void Start(); // Abstract Method
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is starting.");
    }
}
```

### Why Use Abstraction?

* Simplifies complex logic.
* Promotes code flexibility.

### Best Practices

* Use abstraction for defining common behavior.
* Choose interfaces for behavior, abstract classes for shared code.

### Interview Questions

1. What is Abstraction?
2. What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract Class?
3. Can you instantiate an Abstract Class?

This guide provides a complete understanding of OOP principles in C#, including core concepts, detailed code examples, best practices, and common interview questions. Understanding these principles is critical for any C# developer, from beginner to advanced level.

# Advanced OOP Concepts in C# - Complete Guide

## Introduction

This guide is a continuation of the OOP Principles guide, focusing on advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#. These concepts are essential for building scalable, maintainable, and robust software systems. We will cover the following advanced OOP topics:

1. **SOLID Principles**
2. **Design Patterns:**

   * Factory Pattern
   * Singleton Pattern
   * Strategy Pattern

Each topic will be explained in detail with:

* Clear definitions and purpose
* Code examples with explanations
* Best practices and common pitfalls
* Real-world use cases
* Interview questions and answers

---

## Chapter 1: SOLID Principles

### What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software systems:

* **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
* **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
* **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
* **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
* **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

### Detailed Explanation of Each Principle

#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

"A class should have only one reason to change."

#### Code Example:

```csharp
// Violating SRP
public class UserManager
{
    public void CreateUser(string username) { /* Logic to create user */ }
    public void SendWelcomeEmail(string email) { /* Logic to send email */ }
}

// Following SRP
public class UserCreator
{
    public void CreateUser(string username) { /* Logic to create user */ }
}

public class EmailService
{
    public void SendWelcomeEmail(string email) { /* Logic to send email */ }
}
```

#### Best Practices

* Ensure that each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
* Separate logic into focused, cohesive classes.

#### Interview Questions

1. What is SRP?
2. Why is SRP important?
3. How would you identify a class violating SRP?

---

## Chapter 2: Factory Design Pattern

### What is the Factory Pattern?

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a method for creating objects without specifying the exact class type.

### Code Example

```csharp
public interface IProduct
{
    void Display();
}

public class ProductA : IProduct
{
    public void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Product A");
}

public class ProductB : IProduct
{
    public void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Product B");
}

public class ProductFactory
{
    public static IProduct CreateProduct(string type)
    {
        return type switch
        {
            "A" => new ProductA(),
            "B" => new ProductB(),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid type")
        };
    }
}
```

### Why Use the Factory Pattern?

* Simplifies object creation logic.
* Allows switching between concrete implementations without modifying client code.

### Best Practices

* Use for complex object creation.
* Avoid using for simple objects (overkill).

### Interview Questions

1. What is the Factory Pattern?
2. When should you use it?
3. Can you implement Factory without using a switch statement?

---

## Chapter 3: Singleton Design Pattern

### What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to that instance.

### Code Example

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = new Singleton();
                }
                return _instance;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Why Use the Singleton Pattern?

* Ensures a single, consistent instance.
* Commonly used for logging, configuration, or caching.

### Best Practices

* Use thread-safe implementation.
* Avoid excessive use (can become a global state).

### Interview Questions

1. What is the Singleton Pattern?
2. How do you make a Singleton thread-safe?
3. Can you use a Lazy<T> for Singleton in C#?

---

## Chapter 4: Strategy Design Pattern

### What is the Strategy Pattern?

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.

### Code Example

```csharp
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) => Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} with Credit Card.");
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount) => Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} with PayPal.");
}

public class PaymentProcessor
{
    private readonly IPaymentStrategy _paymentStrategy;

    public PaymentProcessor(IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
    {
        _paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount)
    {
        _paymentStrategy.Pay(amount);
    }
}
```

### Why Use the Strategy Pattern?

* Promotes flexibility and scalability.
* Allows different algorithms to be used interchangeably.

### Best Practices

* Use for algorithms with interchangeable logic.
* Favor composition over inheritance.

### Interview Questions

1. What is the Strategy Pattern?
2. What is the difference between Strategy and Factory Patterns?
3. Can you use Strategy without interfaces?

## Conclusion

This guide provides an in-depth understanding of advanced OOP concepts in C#, including SOLID principles and key design patterns (Factory, Singleton, and Strategy). Mastering these concepts is essential for designing robust, scalable software applications.

# Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core - Complete Guide

## Introduction

Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental design pattern in ASP.NET Core, enabling the creation of loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable applications. This guide covers everything you need to know about Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

---

## Chapter 1: Understanding Dependency Injection (DI)

### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern where objects (dependencies) are provided to a class, rather than the class creating them itself. It helps decouple the code and makes it more maintainable and testable.

### Key Concepts

* **Service**: A class that provides functionality.
* **Dependency**: An object required by another object.
* **Injection**: Providing the dependency to a class (via constructor, method, or property).

### Why Use Dependency Injection?

* Promotes Loose Coupling.
* Enhances Testability.
* Simplifies Configuration and Setup.

---

## Chapter 2: DI in ASP.NET Core

### How DI Works in ASP.NET Core

* ASP.NET Core has a built-in DI container (ServiceProvider).
* Services are registered in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file.
* Services can be registered with different lifetimes:

  * **Transient**: New instance for every request.
  * **Scoped**: One instance per request.
  * **Singleton**: One instance for the application lifetime.

### Code Example: Basic DI Setup

```csharp
// Program.cs in ASP.NET Core
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Registering Services
builder.Services.AddTransient<IEmailService, EmailService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILoggingService, LoggingService>();

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();

// Service Interfaces and Implementations
public interface IEmailService
{
    void SendEmail(string message);
}

public class EmailService : IEmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Email Sent: {message}");
    }
}
```

### Using DI in Controllers

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    // Constructor Injection
    public HomeController(IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        _emailService.SendEmail("Welcome to Dependency Injection!");
        return View();
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

* Prefer constructor injection over property or method injection.
* Register dependencies using the correct lifetime (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).
* Avoid using service locator (anti-pattern).

---

## Chapter 3: Advanced DI Techniques

### 1. Named or Multiple Implementations

* Multiple implementations can be registered and resolved using factory methods.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<IEmailService, SmtpEmailService>();
builder.Services.AddTransient<IEmailService, SendGridEmailService>();
```

### 2. Conditional Dependency Resolution

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<IEmailService>(provider =>
{
    var config = provider.GetService<IConfiguration>();
    return config["EmailProvider"] == "Smtp"
        ? new SmtpEmailService()
        : new SendGridEmailService();
});
```

### 3. DI with Options Pattern

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<MySettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("MySettings"));
```

### 4. DI with Factory Methods

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<IProductService>(provider =>
{
    var isPremium = provider.GetService<IUserService>().IsPremiumUser();
    return isPremium ? new PremiumProductService() : new StandardProductService();
});
```

### 5. Service Provider Validation

* ASP.NET Core can validate service registrations at startup for correctness.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers().AddControllersAsServices();
```

---

## Chapter 4: Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

### 1. Service Locator Anti-Pattern

```csharp
// Bad Practice
var emailService = HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService<IEmailService>();
```

* This approach breaks the DI principle and should be avoided.

### 2. Overusing Singleton Services

* Avoid storing scoped services in singletons.

### 3. Constructor Over-Injection

* Avoid injecting too many dependencies into a single class.

---

## Chapter 5: DI Best Practices

* Use interfaces for services.
* Prefer constructor injection for mandatory dependencies.
* Avoid using service locator.
* Use the correct service lifetime (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).
* Validate DI setup at startup.

---

## Chapter 6: Interview Questions

1. What is Dependency Injection?
2. What are the different DI lifetimes in ASP.NET Core?
3. What is the Service Locator Anti-Pattern?
4. Can you explain Constructor Injection vs. Property Injection?
5. How can you implement multiple service implementations?
6. How do you use the Options pattern with DI?

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete understanding of Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core, from basic to advanced techniques. Mastering DI is essential for building scalable, maintainable, and testable ASP.NET Core applications.

# Memory Management in C# - Complete Guide

## Introduction

Memory management is a critical aspect of developing efficient and robust applications in C#. Understanding how memory is allocated, managed, and released can significantly improve application performance. This guide covers everything you need to know about memory management in C#, including:

1. **Garbage Collection (GC)**
2. **IDisposable and Dispose Pattern**
3. **Value Types vs. Reference Types**

We will explore each topic in detail with explanations, best practices, code examples, and common interview questions.

---

## Chapter 1: Garbage Collection (GC)

### What is Garbage Collection?

Garbage Collection (GC) is an automatic memory management feature in .NET that automatically frees unused objects from memory, preventing memory leaks.

### How Garbage Collection Works

* **Generational Garbage Collection:**

  * Generation 0: Short-lived objects (frequent collections).
  * Generation 1: Medium-lived objects (less frequent collections).
  * Generation 2: Long-lived objects (rarely collected).
* **GC Phases:**

  1. Mark: Identifies live objects.
  2. Sweep: Releases memory of dead objects.
  3. Compact: Optimizes memory layout.

### Code Example

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
        {
            var data = new byte[1024]; // Allocating memory
        }

        // Forcing GC Collection (Not recommended in production)
        GC.Collect();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

        Console.WriteLine("Garbage Collection Complete.");
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

* Avoid manually calling `GC.Collect()`.
* Minimize object allocations inside loops.
* Use pooling for frequently used objects.

### Interview Questions

1. What is Garbage Collection?
2. What are the GC generations?
3. How does GC determine which objects to collect?

---

## Chapter 2: IDisposable and Dispose Pattern

### What is IDisposable?

IDisposable is an interface that defines a `Dispose()` method for releasing unmanaged resources (like file handles, database connections, etc.).

### Why Use IDisposable?

* To release unmanaged resources explicitly.
* To prevent resource leaks.

### Code Example

```csharp
public class FileManager : IDisposable
{
    private FileStream _fileStream;

    public FileManager(string filePath)
    {
        _fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    }

    public void ReadFile()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Reading file...");
    }

    // Implementing Dispose
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _fileStream?.Dispose();
        Console.WriteLine("File stream disposed.");
    }
}

// Using IDisposable
using (var fileManager = new FileManager("example.txt"))
{
    fileManager.ReadFile();
}
```

### The Dispose Pattern (Advanced)

* For complex classes, use a more robust Dispose pattern with a `finalizer`.

```csharp
public class ResourceManager : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false;

    ~ResourceManager() // Finalizer
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Release managed resources
            }
            // Release unmanaged resources
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

* Use `using` or `await using` blocks for IDisposable objects.
* Always implement `Dispose` when using unmanaged resources.
* Avoid finalizers unless necessary.

# IDisposable and Dispose Pattern in C# - Complete Guide

## 1. What is IDisposable?

### Answer:

IDisposable is an interface in C# that provides a standardized way to release unmanaged resources (like file handles, database connections, network streams) held by a class.

### Key Concepts:

* IDisposable is part of the System namespace.
* It defines a single method: `Dispose()`.
* It is commonly used for classes that manage unmanaged resources.

### Code Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class FileManager : IDisposable
{
    private FileStream _fileStream;

    public FileManager(string filePath)
    {
        _fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    }

    public void ReadFile()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Reading file...");
    }

    // Implementing Dispose
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _fileStream?.Dispose();
        Console.WriteLine("File stream disposed.");
    }
}

// Usage
using (var fileManager = new FileManager("example.txt"))
{
    fileManager.ReadFile();
}
```

### Why Use IDisposable?

* To ensure that unmanaged resources are released promptly.
* To prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

---

## 2. What is the Dispose Pattern?

### Answer:

The Dispose Pattern is a best practice for properly releasing both managed and unmanaged resources in a class that implements `IDisposable`.

### Key Concepts:

* Ensures deterministic resource cleanup (manual release of resources).
* Prevents resource leaks even if `Dispose()` is not called directly.
* Often used with a finalizer (`~ClassName`) for additional safety.

### Code Example (Full Dispose Pattern):

```csharp
public class ResourceManager : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false;

    ~ResourceManager() // Finalizer
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevents finalizer call
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Release managed resources
            }

            // Release unmanaged resources
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### Why Use the Dispose Pattern?

* Provides a consistent way to release resources.
* Prevents resource leaks even if `Dispose()` is not called explicitly.
* GC.SuppressFinalize() improves performance by skipping the finalizer.

---

## 3. What is the difference between Dispose() and Finalize()?

### Answer:

| Aspect         | Dispose()                    | Finalize()                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Usage          | Explicit (manual) cleanup    | Automatic (by GC)                     |
| Implementation | IDisposable interface        | Finalizer (\~ClassName)               |
| Performance    | Fast (Immediate)             | Slow (Delayed by GC)                  |
| Control        | Full control (deterministic) | No direct control (non-deterministic) |

### Key Differences:

* Dispose() is called manually by the developer, usually through a `using` statement.
* Finalize() is called automatically by the Garbage Collector (GC) for cleanup.
* Dispose() should be used for both managed and unmanaged resources.
* Finalize() should only be used for unmanaged resources as a safety net.

### Code Example

```csharp
public class Example : IDisposable
{
    ~Example() // Finalizer
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Finalizer Called.");
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dispose Called.");
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevents Finalizer
    }
}

// Usage
var obj = new Example();
obj.Dispose(); // Calls Dispose
```

### Best Practices

* Always use `using` for IDisposable objects.
* Avoid using Finalizers unless absolutely necessary.
* Use Dispose Pattern for complex classes with both managed and unmanaged resources.

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete understanding of IDisposable, the Dispose Pattern, and the differences between Dispose() and Finalize() in C#. Mastering these concepts is essential for building efficient, memory-safe .NET applications.


---

## Chapter 3: Value Types vs Reference Types

### What are Value Types and Reference Types?

* **Value Types:** Stored on the stack. Copies are created when assigned.

  * Examples: int, double, struct, bool.

* **Reference Types:** Stored on the heap. A reference (pointer) is created.

  * Examples: class, string, array, object.

### Code Example

```csharp
// Value Type Example
int a = 10;
int b = a;
b = 20;
Console.WriteLine(a); // 10

// Reference Type Example
class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

Person person1 = new Person { Name = "John" };
Person person2 = person1;
person2.Name = "Doe";
Console.WriteLine(person1.Name); // Doe
```

### Best Practices

* Use value types for small, simple data.
* Use reference types for complex objects.
* Understand the difference for performance optimization.

### Interview Questions

1. What are Value Types and Reference Types?
2. How are Value Types and Reference Types stored in memory?
3. Can you create a custom Value Type?

---

## Chapter 4: Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

* Avoid unnecessary object allocations.
* Use the `using` statement for IDisposable objects.
* Use value types for small, immutable data.
* Use reference types for complex objects.

### Common Pitfalls

* Misusing IDisposable without proper Dispose pattern.
* Excessive object allocations (causing GC overhead).
* Confusion between value and reference types.

---

## 1. What is Garbage Collection in C#?

### Answer:

Garbage Collection (GC) in C# is an automatic memory management feature of the .NET runtime that reclaims unused memory by identifying and removing objects that are no longer accessible.

### Key Concepts:

* **Automatic Memory Management:** GC automatically frees memory without developer intervention.
* **Generational Collection:** Objects are categorized into three generations (Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2) based on their lifespan.
* **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm:** GC uses a mark-and-sweep process to identify and clear unused objects.

### Example:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
        {
            var data = new byte[1024]; // Memory allocation
        }
        GC.Collect(); // Manually triggers GC (not recommended in production)
        Console.WriteLine("Garbage Collection Complete.");
    }
}
```

---

## 2. What is the difference between Dispose() and Finalize()?

### Answer:

* **Dispose():** Explicit method for releasing unmanaged resources, implemented through `IDisposable`.
* **Finalize():** Automatic method for releasing unmanaged resources, called by GC as a safety net.

### Key Differences:

| Aspect         | Dispose()                    | Finalize()                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Usage          | Explicit (manual) cleanup    | Automatic (by GC)                     |
| Implementation | IDisposable interface        | Finalizer (\~ClassName)               |
| Performance    | Fast (Immediate)             | Slow (Delayed by GC)                  |
| Control        | Full control (deterministic) | No direct control (non-deterministic) |

### Code Example:

```csharp
public class ResourceManager : IDisposable
{
    ~ResourceManager() // Finalizer
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Finalizer Called.");
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dispose Called.");
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
```

## 3. What are Value Types and Reference Types?

### Answer:

* **Value Types:** Stored in stack memory, directly contain data.

  * Examples: int, double, bool, struct.
* **Reference Types:** Stored in heap memory, contain a reference (pointer) to the actual data.

  * Examples: string, array, class, object.

### Key Differences:

| Aspect           | Value Types                   | Reference Types                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Storage Location | Stack                         | Heap                                   |
| Copying          | Creates a new copy            | Copies reference (points to same data) |
| Null Assignment  | Not allowed (except nullable) | Allowed                                |

### Code Example:

```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = a; // Value Copy
b = 20;
Console.WriteLine(a); // Output: 10

class Person { public string Name; }
Person p1 = new Person { Name = "John" };
Person p2 = p1; // Reference Copy
p2.Name = "Doe";
Console.WriteLine(p1.Name); // Output: Doe
```

---

## 4. What is the Dispose Pattern?

### Answer:

The Dispose Pattern is a best practice for properly releasing unmanaged resources in a C# class using `IDisposable`.

### Code Example (Full Dispose Pattern):

```csharp
public class ResourceManager : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false;

    ~ResourceManager() // Finalizer
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Release managed resources
            }
            // Release unmanaged resources
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts:

* Prevents resource leaks.
* Provides a consistent approach for resource cleanup.
* GC.SuppressFinalize() prevents unnecessary finalizer calls.

---

## 5. When should you use IDisposable?

### Answer:

* Use IDisposable when your class holds unmanaged resources (e.g., file handles, database connections, streams).
* Use IDisposable to ensure that resources are released promptly using `Dispose()`.

### Example:

```csharp
using (FileStream file = new FileStream("example.txt", FileMode.Open))
{
    // Use the file
}
// FileStream is disposed automatically at the end of the using block
```

---

## 6. How can you optimize memory management in C#?

### Answer:

* Minimize object allocations.
* Use the `using` statement for IDisposable objects.
* Use StringBuilder for string manipulations.
* Prefer value types for small data.
* Avoid memory leaks by properly implementing `IDisposable`.
* Use object pooling for frequently used objects.
* Use WeakReference for large objects that should be collected when not needed.

### Example:

```csharp
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); // Better for multiple string concatenations
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
    sb.Append($"Line {i}\n");
}
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
```

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides complete answers to the most common interview questions on memory management in C#, including Garbage Collection, IDisposable, Dispose Pattern, Value Types vs Reference Types, and optimization techniques.


# Async Programming and Multithreading in C# - Complete Guide

## Introduction

Asynchronous programming and multithreading are essential for building high-performance, scalable applications in C#. Understanding these concepts allows you to create responsive applications, optimize resource usage, and handle multiple tasks efficiently. This guide will cover:

1. **Threads and Threading Basics**
2. **The Task Parallel Library (TPL)**
3. **Async/Await Pattern**
4. **Parallel Programming (Parallel.For, Parallel.ForEach)**
5. **Advanced Techniques and Best Practices**

---

## Chapter 1: Threads and Threading Basics

### What are Threads?

* A thread is a lightweight process that can run independently.
* C# allows creating and managing threads using the `System.Threading` namespace.

### Code Example: Basic Thread

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Thread thread = new Thread(PrintNumbers);
        thread.Start();

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Main Thread: {i}");
            Thread.Sleep(500);
        }
    }

    static void PrintNumbers()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Worker Thread: {i}");
            Thread.Sleep(500);
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

* Thread Creation: `Thread thread = new Thread(MethodName);`
* Thread Start: `thread.Start();`
* Thread Sleep: `Thread.Sleep(milliseconds);`

### Best Practices

* Minimize direct use of `Thread` - prefer `Task` or `Parallel`.
* Always handle exceptions in threads.

---

## Chapter 2: The Task Parallel Library (TPL)

### What is the Task Parallel Library?

* The TPL provides a higher-level API for working with concurrency in C#.
* It is the recommended way for multi-threaded programming.

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        await Task.Run(() => PrintNumbers());
        Console.WriteLine("Task Completed.");
    }

    static void PrintNumbers()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Task: {i}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

* `Task` for lightweight, managed threads.
* `Task.Run()` for running tasks in the background.
* `await` for asynchronous execution.

### Best Practices

* Use `Task` for non-blocking operations.
* Always use `await` for asynchronous methods.

---

## Chapter 3: Async/Await Pattern

### What is Async/Await?

* `async` is a keyword that marks a method as asynchronous.
* `await` is used to pause the method until the task completes.

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting...");
        await FetchDataAsync();
        Console.WriteLine("Finished.");
    }

    static async Task FetchDataAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(2000); // Simulating async operation
        Console.WriteLine("Data Fetched");
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

* Asynchronous methods do not block the main thread.
* Only use `await` in `async` methods.
* Return types can be `Task`, `Task<T>`, or `void` (for event handlers).

### Best Practices

* Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound tasks (like HTTP calls).
* Avoid blocking with `.Wait()` or `.Result()`.

---

## Chapter 4: Parallel Programming

### What is Parallel Programming?

* Allows executing multiple operations concurrently.
* Uses `Parallel.For`, `Parallel.ForEach` for data parallelism.

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Parallel.For(0, 5, i =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Parallel Task: {i}");
        });
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

* `Parallel.For` for parallel loops.
* `Parallel.ForEach` for parallel collections.

### Best Practices

* Use for CPU-bound tasks (intensive calculations).
* Avoid using for I/O-bound operations.

---

## Chapter 5: Advanced Techniques

### 1. Exception Handling in Async Methods

* Use `try`/`catch` in async methods.

```csharp
async Task FetchDataAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await Task.Delay(2000);
        throw new Exception("Error in Fetching");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### 2. Configuring Task Schedulers

* Use `TaskScheduler.Default` for standard scheduling.
* Create custom TaskSchedulers for custom thread control.

### 3. Deadlocks and Synchronization Context

* Avoid blocking async methods with `.Wait()` or `.Result()`.
* Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` for library code to prevent deadlocks.

### 4. Task Cancellation

```csharp
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
await Task.Run(() => LongRunningTask(cts.Token), cts.Token);
cts.Cancel();
```

---

## Chapter 6: Best Practices

* Prefer `async/await` for I/O-bound operations.
* Prefer `Parallel` for CPU-bound operations.
* Avoid using `Task.Run` for CPU-bound work in ASP.NET Core (use `IHostedService`).
* Handle exceptions properly in async methods.

---

## Chapter 7: Interview Questions


1. **What is the difference between Task and Thread?**

   * Task is a higher-level API for concurrency, managed by the Task Scheduler, while Thread is a lower-level construct for creating threads manually.

2. **When should you use async/await over Task.Run()?**

   * Use async/await for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network calls). Use Task.Run() for CPU-bound tasks in console applications.

3. **What is a deadlock, and how do you prevent it in async code?**

   * A deadlock occurs when two tasks wait for each other, causing a freeze. Prevent it using ConfigureAwait(false) for library code.

4. **What is the difference between Parallel.For and Task.Run()?**

   * Parallel.For is for data parallelism (multiple iterations), while Task.Run is for launching a background task.

5. **How can you cancel a Task?**

   * Use a CancellationToken and pass it to the Task method.

6. **What is ConfigureAwait(false), and when should you use it?**

   * It prevents async tasks from capturing the current synchronization context, avoiding deadlocks in library code.

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete understanding of Async Programming and Multithreading in C#, including Threads, Tasks, Async/Await, and Parallel Programming. Mastering these concepts is essential for building scalable, responsive applications.

# Thread Safety, Locks, Monitor, and Semaphore in C# - Complete Guide

## Introduction

Thread safety is a critical concept in multi-threaded applications. It ensures that shared data is accessed in a consistent manner, preventing data corruption and unexpected behavior. This guide covers:

1. **Thread Safety and Why It Matters**
2. **Locks in C# (lock keyword)**
3. **Monitor Class for Advanced Locking**
4. **Semaphore and SemaphoreSlim**
5. **Best Practices for Thread Safety**
6. **Common Pitfalls and Interview Questions**

---

## Chapter 1: Understanding Thread Safety

### What is Thread Safety?

Thread safety is a concept in which shared data can be accessed by multiple threads without causing data corruption.

### Why is Thread Safety Important?

* Prevents data corruption in multi-threaded environments.
* Ensures consistent data access.
* Prevents race conditions (when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously).

### Example of a Thread Safety Problem

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Counter
{
    private int count = 0;

    public void Increment()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int GetCount() => count;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(counter.Increment);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(counter.Increment);

        t1.Start();
        t2.Start();

        t1.Join();
        t2.Join();

        Console.WriteLine($"Final Count: {counter.GetCount()}"); // Result is inconsistent
    }
}
```

### Why This is Problematic:

* Multiple threads access and modify `count` without synchronization.
* Results in data corruption due to race conditions.

---

## Chapter 2: Using Locks (lock keyword)

### What is a Lock?

A lock is a thread synchronization mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time.

### How Locks Work:

* Only one thread can enter the locked section at a time.
* Other threads wait until the lock is released.

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Counter
{
    private int count = 0;
    private readonly object _lock = new object();

    public void Increment()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    public int GetCount() => count;
}
```

### Best Practices for Locks

* Use a private object as the lock object (not `this`).
* Keep the locked section as short as possible.
* Avoid deadlocks (two locks waiting on each other).

---

## Chapter 3: Monitor Class

### What is Monitor?

The `Monitor` class provides advanced locking capabilities similar to the lock keyword but with additional control.

### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Counter
{
    private int count = 0;
    private readonly object _lock = new object();

    public void Increment()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            Monitor.Enter(_lock);
            try
            {
                count++;
            }
            finally
            {
                Monitor.Exit(_lock);
            }
        }
    }

    public int GetCount() => count;
}
```

### Why Use Monitor?

* Provides more control with `Monitor.TryEnter()` (non-blocking).
* Allows timeout-based locking.

---

## Chapter 4: Semaphore and SemaphoreSlim

### What is Semaphore?

A Semaphore is a thread synchronization mechanism that limits the number of threads that can access a resource simultaneously.

### Code Example (Semaphore)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(2, 2); // Max 2 threads

    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            Thread thread = new Thread(AccessResource);
            thread.Start(i);
        }
    }

    static void AccessResource(object id)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} waiting...");
        semaphore.WaitOne();
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} entered.");
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} leaving.");
        semaphore.Release();
    }
}
```

### What is SemaphoreSlim?

* A lightweight, faster version of Semaphore for local thread synchronization.
* Uses a non-blocking approach for high performance.

### When to Use SemaphoreSlim?

* When you only need to synchronize local threads (not across processes).

---

## Chapter 5: Best Practices for Thread Safety

* Use `lock` for simple scenarios.
* Use `Monitor` for advanced locking control.
* Use `SemaphoreSlim` for lightweight, multi-threaded synchronization.
* Minimize the code inside locked sections.
* Avoid locking on public objects (risk of deadlock).

---

## Chapter 6: Common Pitfalls

* Using `lock(this)` - Can cause deadlock if other code locks the same object.
* Holding a lock for too long - Reduces performance.
* Not handling exceptions in locked sections - Causes deadlocks.

---

## Chapter 7: Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is thread safety, and why is it important?**

   * Thread safety ensures that shared data is accessed in a consistent manner, preventing data corruption in multi-threaded environments.

2. **What is the difference between lock and Monitor?**

   * `lock` is a simplified wrapper around `Monitor.Enter()` and `Monitor.Exit()`, while `Monitor` provides more control (e.g., TryEnter).

3. **When would you use Semaphore over lock?**

   * Use Semaphore when you need to limit access to a resource by multiple threads (e.g., max 3 threads).

4. **What is the difference between Semaphore and SemaphoreSlim?**

   * Semaphore is for cross-process synchronization, while SemaphoreSlim is optimized for intra-process synchronization.

5. **How do you prevent deadlocks?**

   * Use a consistent lock order, avoid nested locks, and use `Monitor.TryEnter()` with a timeout.

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete understanding of thread safety, locks, Monitor, and Semaphore in C#. Mastering these concepts is essential for building robust, multi-threaded applications.

# Async/Await in ASP.NET Core - Complete Guide

## Introduction

Async/Await is a powerful asynchronous programming model in C# that allows for non-blocking operations, improving the scalability and responsiveness of web applications. In ASP.NET Core, Async/Await is widely used in controllers, middleware, and services. This guide will cover:

1. **Understanding Async/Await in ASP.NET Core**
2. **Creating Async Controllers**
3. **Async Database Access with Entity Framework Core**
4. **Best Practices for Async Controllers**
5. **Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**
6. **Interview Questions and Answers**

---

## Chapter 1: Understanding Async/Await in ASP.NET Core

### What is Async/Await?

* `async` is a keyword that marks a method as asynchronous.
* `await` is used to pause the method until the awaited task completes.
* Async/Await allows non-blocking execution, improving scalability.

### Why Use Async/Await in ASP.NET Core?

* Improves scalability by freeing up threads for other requests.
* Reduces response times for I/O-bound operations (like database calls).

---

## Chapter 2: Creating Async Controllers

### What is an Async Controller?

* An async controller is an ASP.NET Core controller that uses async methods for non-blocking I/O operations.
* It allows the server to handle more requests without blocking threads.

### Code Example: Basic Async Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    // Simulating a long-running I/O operation
    [HttpGet("async-products")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetProductsAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(2000); // Simulating delay
        return Ok(new string[] { "Product 1", "Product 2", "Product 3" });
    }
}
```

### How This Works:

* The `async` keyword makes the method asynchronous.
* `await` pauses the method until the task is complete without blocking the thread.
* The method returns a `Task<IActionResult>`, making it asynchronous.

### Best Practices

* Use async for all I/O-bound operations (like database calls, API requests).
* Avoid using async for CPU-bound operations (use Task.Run instead).
* Always use `await` with async methods.

---

## Chapter 3: Async Database Access with Entity Framework Core

### Why Use Async with EF Core?

* Async queries prevent thread blocking during database operations.
* Improves scalability for high-traffic applications.

### Code Example: Async Database Query

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
}

public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    [HttpGet("async-products-db")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetProductsFromDatabaseAsync()
    {
        List<Product> products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
        return Ok(products);
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

* Always use `ToListAsync()`, `FirstOrDefaultAsync()`, `AnyAsync()` with EF Core.
* Avoid using synchronous database methods (like `ToList()` or `FirstOrDefault()`).

---

## Chapter 4: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

* **Blocking Async Methods:** Avoid using `.Result` or `.Wait()` on async methods.
* **Deadlocks:** Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code to prevent deadlocks.
* **Overusing Async:** Do not use async for CPU-bound tasks (like image processing).

### Example of a Deadlock

```csharp
// Avoid this
public IActionResult GetData()
{
    var result = GetDataAsync().Result; // Causes deadlock
    return Ok(result);
}

// Use this
public async Task<IActionResult> GetDataAsync()
{
    var result = await FetchDataAsync();
    return Ok(result);
}
```

---

## Chapter 5: Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is an Async Controller in ASP.NET Core?**

   * An async controller uses async methods to handle requests without blocking threads.

2. **Why should you use Async/Await in ASP.NET Core Controllers?**

   * It improves scalability and responsiveness for I/O-bound operations.

3. **What is the difference between Async and Sync database queries in EF Core?**

   * Async queries (like `ToListAsync()`) do not block the thread, while sync queries do.

4. **How do you prevent deadlocks in Async methods?**

   * Avoid using `.Wait()` or `.Result()` and use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code.

5. **When should you avoid using Async in ASP.NET Core?**

   * For CPU-bound tasks (like image processing or calculations).

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete understanding of Async/Await in ASP.NET Core, including Async Controllers, Async Database Access, best practices, and common pitfalls. Mastering async/await is essential for building scalable, responsive web applications.


# ASP.NET Core Web API - Clean Architecture with CQRS and MediatR

## Introduction

This guide covers building a scalable and maintainable ASP.NET Core Web API using Clean Architecture with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and MediatR. This approach ensures a modular structure, testability, and separation of concerns.

### What is Clean Architecture?

* A software architecture pattern that promotes separation of concerns.
* Divides the application into independent layers:

  * **Presentation (API)**
  * **Application (CQRS, Business Logic)**
  * **Domain (Entities, Interfaces)**
  * **Infrastructure (Database, External Services)**

### What is CQRS?

* Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern that separates read (queries) and write (commands) operations.
* Queries only fetch data, while Commands perform actions.

### What is MediatR?

* MediatR is a lightweight library for implementing CQRS using the Mediator pattern.
* It decouples the sender (controller) from the receiver (handlers).

    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public CreateProductCommandHandler(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<int> Handle(CreateProductCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var product = new Product { Name = request.Name, Price = request.Price };
        _context.Products.Add(product);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
        return product.Id;
    }
}
```

### Create Product Query (GetAllProductsQuery)

```csharp
using MediatR;
using Domain.Entities;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Application.Queries
{
    public record GetAllProductsQuery() : IRequest<List<Product>>;
}
```

### Create Query Handler

```csharp
using Application.Queries;
using Domain.Entities;
using Infrastructure.Persistence;
using MediatR;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class GetAllProductsQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetAllProductsQuery, List<Product>>
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public GetAllProductsQueryHandler(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<List<Product>> Handle(GetAllProductsQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return await _context.Products.ToListAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

---

## Step 5: Implementing the API Layer

### Setting Up the Controller

```csharp
using Application.Commands;
using Application.Queries;
using MediatR;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;

    public ProductsController(IMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CreateProduct(CreateProductCommand command)
    {
        var productId = await _mediator.Send(command);
        return Ok(productId);
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetProducts()
    {
        var products = await _mediator.Send(new GetAllProductsQuery());
        return Ok(products);
    }
}
```

---

## Step 6: Configuring Dependency Injection (API/Program.cs)

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMediatR(typeof(CreateProductCommandHandler).Assembly);
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

# Modular Project Structure in ASP.NET Core - API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure

## Introduction

A modular project structure is a best practice for building scalable and maintainable ASP.NET Core applications. This structure divides the application into four main layers:

* **API (Presentation Layer)**: Handles HTTP requests and user interactions.
* **Application (Business Logic Layer)**: Contains business logic, CQRS, and MediatR.
* **Domain (Core Entities and Interfaces)**: Defines the core entities, enums, and interfaces.
* **Infrastructure (Database and External Services)**: Manages data persistence and external services.

This guide will cover how to set up and structure a modular ASP.NET Core solution, with clear explanations and code examples.

---

## Why Use a Modular Project Structure?

* **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a clear responsibility.
* **Scalability:** Easy to add new features without affecting other layers.
* **Testability:** Business logic is isolated and testable.
* **Maintainability:** Code is organized and easy to navigate.

---

## Project Structure

### Recommended Folder Structure

```
📂 YourProject
├── 📂 API (Presentation Layer)

│   └── Services (External APIs)
│   └── Configurations
└── 📂 Tests (Unit and Integration Tests)
```

---

## Step 1: Setting Up the Solution

### Create the Solution and Projects

```bash
mkdir ModularArchitecture
cd ModularArchitecture

# Create the Solution and Projects
dotnet new sln -n ModularArchitecture

dotnet new webapi -n API
dotnet new classlib -n Application
dotnet new classlib -n Domain
dotnet new classlib -n Infrastructure

# Add Projects to Solution
dotnet sln add API/API.csproj

dotnet sln add Application/Application.csproj

dotnet sln add Domain/Domain.csproj

dotnet sln add Infrastructure/Infrastructure.csproj
```

### Set Project Dependencies

* API -> Application, Infrastructure
* Application -> Domain
* Infrastructure -> Application, Domain

```bash
cd API
dotnet add reference ../Application/Application.csproj
cd ../Application
dotnet add reference ../Domain/Domain.csproj
cd ../Infrastructure
dotnet add reference ../Application/Application.csproj
```

---

## Step 2: Setting Up the API Project

### Controllers

* All HTTP endpoints are managed in the API project.
* Use dependency injection to access services.

### Example Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Application.Interfaces;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IProductService _productService;

    public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetProducts()
    {
        var products = _productService.GetAllProducts();
        return Ok(products);
    }
}
```

---

## Step 3: Setting Up the Application Project

### Commands and Queries (CQRS)

* The Application layer contains all business logic (CQRS, MediatR).

### Example Command

```csharp
namespace Application.Commands
{
    public record CreateProductCommand(string Name, decimal Price);
}
```

### Example Query

```csharp
namespace Application.Queries
{
    public record GetAllProductsQuery();
}
```

### Services and Interfaces

* Interfaces define service contracts.
* Services implement business logic.

```csharp
namespace Application.Interfaces
{
    public interface IProductService
    {
        List<string> GetAllProducts();
    }
}

public class ProductService : IProductService
{
    public List<string> GetAllProducts() => new List<string> { "Product 1", "Product 2" };
}
```

---

## Step 4: Setting Up the Domain Project

### Entities

* The Domain layer defines the core business entities.

```csharp
namespace Domain.Entities
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Interfaces

* Domain interfaces define core rules for the application.

```csharp
namespace Domain.Interfaces
{
    public interface IRepository<T>
    {
        T GetById(int id);
        List<T> GetAll();
    }
}
```

---

## Step 5: Setting Up the Infrastructure Project

### Persistence (EF Core)

* Manages data persistence (EF Core, Repositories).

```csharp
using Domain.Entities;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
}
```

### Repository Implementation

```csharp
using Domain.Entities;
using Domain.Interfaces;

public class ProductRepository : IRepository<Product>
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public ProductRepository(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public List<Product> GetAll() => _context.Products.ToList();
}
```

---

## Step 6: Configuring Dependency Injection (API/Program.cs)

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IRepository<Product>, ProductRepository>();
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete walkthrough of setting up a modular ASP.NET Core solution with API, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. It ensures clean architecture, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

# Securing ASP.NET Core API with JWT Authentication and Role-Based Authorization

## Introduction

This guide covers how to secure an ASP.NET Core Web API using JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication and Role-Based Authorization. This approach ensures that only authenticated users with specific roles can access certain endpoints.

---

## What is JWT Authentication?

* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
* JWT consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.
* In ASP.NET Core, JWT is used for secure API authentication.

### Why Use JWT?

* Stateless Authentication: The server does not store user sessions.
* Scalable: Works well with microservices.
* Secure: Supports claims-based authentication.

---

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create a New API Project

```bash
dotnet new webapi -n SecureAPI
cd SecureAPI
```

### Step 2: Install JWT Authentication Packages

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
```

---

## Step 3: Configure JWT Authentication

### Configure JWT in Program.cs

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.Text;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
    options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
    options.SaveToken = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateIssuer = true,
        ValidateAudience = true,
        ValidateLifetime = true,
        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
        ValidIssuer = builder.Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
        ValidAudience = builder.Configuration["Jwt:Audience"],
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(builder.Configuration["Jwt:SecretKey"]))
    };
});

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AdminPolicy", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
});

builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

### Step 4: Add JWT Configuration in appsettings.json

```json
{
  "Jwt": {
    "Issuer": "YourIssuer",
    "Audience": "YourAudience",
    "SecretKey": "YourSecretKey12345"
  }
}
```

---

## Step 5: Creating a Token Generation Endpoint

### Add Authentication Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Text;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AuthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public AuthController(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    [HttpPost("login")]
    public IActionResult Login(string username, string password)
    {
        if (username == "admin" && password == "password")
        {
            var token = GenerateJwtToken(username);
            return Ok(new { token });
        }

        return Unauthorized();
    }

    private string GenerateJwtToken(string username)
    {
        var claims = new[]
        {
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, username),
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Admin")
        };

        var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_configuration["Jwt:SecretKey"]));
        var creds = new SigningCredentials(key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

        var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
            issuer: _configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
            audience: _configuration["Jwt:Audience"],
            claims: claims,
            expires: DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30),
            signingCredentials: creds
        );

        return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);
    }
}
```

### How It Works:

* Users provide a username and password.
* If valid, a JWT token is generated with username and role claims.
* The token is returned to the user for authentication.

---

## Step 6: Securing API Endpoints

### Create a Secure API Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class SecureDataController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("public")]
    public IActionResult PublicData() => Ok("This is public data.");

    [Authorize]
    [HttpGet("protected")]
    public IActionResult ProtectedData() => Ok("This is protected data.");

    [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
    [HttpGet("admin")]
    public IActionResult AdminData() => Ok("This is admin data.");
}
```

### How It Works:

* Public endpoint: No authentication required.
* Protected endpoint: Requires authentication.
* Admin endpoint: Requires authentication and Admin role.

---

## Step 7: Testing JWT Authentication

* Use Postman or any HTTP client to test:

  * Login: POST /api/auth/login (Receive JWT token)
  * Public Data: GET /api/securedata/public (No JWT required)
  * Protected Data: GET /api/securedata/protected (JWT required)
  * Admin Data: GET /api/securedata/admin (JWT with Admin role required)

---

## Step 8: Best Practices

* Use HTTPS for secure communication.
* Store JWT Secret in Azure Key Vault (or environment variables).
* Use short token expiration times and refresh tokens.
* Validate JWT claims in your controllers.

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete walkthrough for securing an ASP.NET Core Web API with JWT Authentication and Role-Based Authorization. Mastering JWT is essential for building secure, scalable APIs.

# Middleware and Error Handling in ASP.NET Core - Complete Guide

## Introduction

Middleware is a key component of the ASP.NET Core request pipeline. It allows you to process HTTP requests and responses, making it essential for implementing cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

This guide covers:

1. Understanding Middleware in ASP.NET Core
2. Building Custom Middleware
3. Implementing Request and Response Logging Middleware
4. Implementing Centralized Error Handling Middleware
5. Best Practices for Middleware and Error Handling
6. Common Pitfalls and Interview Questions

---

## Chapter 1: Understanding Middleware

### What is Middleware?

* Middleware is a component that processes HTTP requests and responses in the ASP.NET Core request pipeline.
* It is executed in sequence, and each middleware can decide whether to pass the request to the next component.

### How Middleware Works:

* Middleware is added in the `Program.cs` (or Startup.cs) file.
* Each middleware can perform actions before and after the request is processed.

### Example Middleware Pipeline

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Adding Middleware
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Request received");
    await next();
    Console.WriteLine("Response sent");
});

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
});

app.Run();
```

### Output:

```
Request received
Response sent
```

---

## Chapter 2: Building Custom Middleware

### What is Custom Middleware?

* Custom Middleware is a reusable component that you create to process requests and responses in the pipeline.

### How to Create Custom Middleware

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class RequestLoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Method} {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
        Console.WriteLine($"Response: {context.Response.StatusCode}");
    }
}

// Extension Method for Middleware
public static class RequestLoggingMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseRequestLogging(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

### Adding Custom Middleware in Program.cs

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRequestLogging();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello, World!");
app.Run();
```

### Output:

```
Request: GET /
Response: 200
```

---

## Chapter 3: Implementing Request and Response Logging Middleware

### Why Log Requests and Responses?

* Provides visibility into incoming requests and outgoing responses.
* Helps with debugging and monitoring.

### Advanced Logging Middleware

```csharp
public class AdvancedLoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public AdvancedLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Logging Request
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Method} {context.Request.Path}");

        // Clone Response Body
        var originalBodyStream = context.Response.Body;
        using var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
        context.Response.Body = memoryStream;

        await _next(context);

        // Logging Response
        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        string responseBody = new StreamReader(memoryStream).ReadToEnd();
        Console.WriteLine($"Response: {responseBody}");

        // Write back to original response body
        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        await memoryStream.CopyToAsync(originalBodyStream);
    }
}

// Extension Method
public static class AdvancedLoggingMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseAdvancedLogging(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<AdvancedLoggingMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

---

## Chapter 4: Centralized Error Handling Middleware

### Why Use Centralized Error Handling?

* Ensures consistent error responses for all API endpoints.
* Prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the application.

### Error Handling Middleware

```csharp
public class ErrorHandlingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ErrorHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            await HandleExceptionAsync(context, ex);
        }
    }

    private Task HandleExceptionAsync(HttpContext context, Exception exception)
    {
        context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
        context.Response.StatusCode = 500;

        var errorResponse = new { message = "An error occurred.", detail = exception.Message };
        return context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync(errorResponse);
    }
}

// Extension Method
public static class ErrorHandlingMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseErrorHandling(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

### Adding Error Handling Middleware in Program.cs

```csharp
app.UseErrorHandling();
```

---

## Chapter 5: Best Practices for Middleware and Error Handling

* Keep middleware logic simple and focused.
* Use centralized error handling for consistent responses.
* Log errors with detailed context (request URL, headers).
* Avoid logging sensitive information (like passwords).
* Order middleware correctly (Error Handling should be first).

---

## Chapter 6: Common Pitfalls

* Forgetting to call `await next()` in middleware (causes request pipeline to break).
* Logging sensitive information (like passwords) in request/response logs.
* Using `try/catch` directly in controllers instead of centralized middleware.

---

## Chapter 7: Interview Questions

1. What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?
2. How do you create Custom Middleware?
3. How do you implement centralized error handling in ASP.NET Core?
4. What is the difference between `Use`, `Run`, and `Map` in Middleware?
5. Why should you use Error Handling Middleware?

---

## Conclusion

This guide provides a complete understanding of Middleware and Error Handling in ASP.NET Core, including custom middleware, request/response logging, and centralized error handling. Mastering middleware is essential for building robust, maintainable APIs.

{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseErrorHandling(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

---

## Chapter 4: Difference between Use, Run, and Map

* `Use`: Adds middleware that can pass requests to the next middleware.
* `Run`: Adds a terminal middleware that stops the pipeline.
* `Map`: Creates branching logic in the middleware pipeline.

### Example:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => { Console.WriteLine("Use"); await next(); });
app.Run(async context => { Console.WriteLine("Run"); });
```

---

## Chapter 6: Interview Questions

1. **What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Middleware is a component that processes HTTP requests and responses in the request pipeline.

2. **How do you create Custom Middleware?**

   * Create a class with a `RequestDelegate` and an `InvokeAsync` method.
   * Register it using `app.UseMiddleware<YourMiddleware>()`.

3. **How do you implement centralized error handling in ASP.NET Core?**

   * Create custom error handling middleware that catches exceptions and returns a consistent error response.

4. **What is the difference between Use, Run, and Map in Middleware?**

   * `Use` passes control to the next middleware.
   * `Run` is terminal and does not call the next middleware.
   * `Map` creates branches in the pipeline.

5. **Why should you use Error Handling Middleware?**

   * It centralizes error handling and provides consistent responses for all API endpoints.

## Chapter 1: Understanding Middleware

### What is Middleware?

* Middleware is a component that processes HTTP requests and responses in the ASP.NET Core request pipeline.
* It is executed in sequence, and each middleware can decide whether to pass the request to the next component.

### How Middleware Works:

* Middleware is added in the `Program.cs` (or Startup.cs) file.
* Each middleware can perform actions before and after the request is processed.

### Example Middleware Pipeline

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Adding Middleware
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Request received");
    await next();
    Console.WriteLine("Response sent");
});

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
});

app.Run();
```

### Output:

```
Request received
Response sent
```

### Why Use Middleware?

* Adds flexibility to process requests and responses.
* Allows cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, error handling).

---

## Chapter 2: Building Custom Middleware

### What is Custom Middleware?

* Custom Middleware is a reusable component that you create to process requests and responses in the pipeline.

### How to Create Custom Middleware

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class RequestLoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Method} {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
        Console.WriteLine($"Response: {context.Response.StatusCode}");
    }
}

// Extension Method for Middleware
public static class RequestLoggingMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseRequestLogging(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

---

## Chapter 3: Implementing Centralized Error Handling Middleware

### Why Use Centralized Error Handling?

* Ensures consistent error responses for all API endpoints.
* Prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the application.

### Error Handling Middleware

```csharp
public class ErrorHandlingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ErrorHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            await HandleExceptionAsync(context, ex);
        }
    }

    private Task HandleExceptionAsync(HttpContext context, Exception exception)
    {
        context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
        context.Response.StatusCode = 500;

        var errorResponse = new { message = "An error occurred.", detail = exception.Message };
        return context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync(errorResponse);
    }
}
```

---

## Chapter 4: Implementing Global Exception Handling with Problem Details

### What is Problem Details?

* Problem Details is a standardized format for error responses in HTTP APIs.
* Defined by RFC 7807 ([https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807)).

### Code Example

```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
{
    errorApp.Run(async context =>
    {
        context.Response.ContentType = "application/problem+json";
        context.Response.StatusCode = 500;

        var problemDetails = new ProblemDetails
        {
            Title = "An unexpected error occurred.",
            Status = context.Response.StatusCode,
            Detail = "Please try again later."
        };

        await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync(problemDetails);
    });
});
```

### Why Use Problem Details?

* Provides a consistent, standardized error response format.
* Easy to extend with custom properties (e.g., trace ID).

---

## Chapter 5: Difference between Use, Run, and Map

* `Use`: Adds middleware that can pass requests to the next middleware.
* `Run`: Adds a terminal middleware that stops the pipeline.
* `Map`: Creates branching logic in the middleware pipeline.

### Example:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => { Console.WriteLine("Use"); await next(); });
app.Run(async context => { Console.WriteLine("Run"); });
```

---

## Chapter 6: Why Use Error Handling Middleware?

* Provides consistent error responses for all endpoints.
* Prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the app.
* Centralizes error handling logic in one place.

{
    configuration
        .WriteTo.Console()
        .WriteTo.File("logs/app_log.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
        .WriteTo.Seq("http://localhost:5341");
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello, World!");
app.Run();
```

### How This Works:

* Console: Logs to the console window.
* File: Logs to a text file (rotates daily).
* Seq: Logs to a Seq server (HTTP-based logging platform).

### Setting Up Seq (Optional)

* Install Seq from [https://datalust.co/seq](https://datalust.co/seq).
* Start Seq server on [http://localhost:5341](http://localhost:5341).
* Monitor and search logs in the Seq dashboard.

### Example Logs:

```
2023-05-08 12:00:00 [INF] HTTP GET / responded 200 in 10ms
2023-05-08 12:00:10 [ERR] An error occurred: NullReferenceException
```

cd RealTimeChatApp
dotnet new web -n RealTimeChatApp
```

### Install SignalR Package

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
```

---

## Chapter 3: Building the Real-time Chat Hub

### Creating the Chat Hub

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
}
```

### How This Works:

* The `SendMessage` method broadcasts a message to all connected clients using `Clients.All`.
* Clients receive the message using the `ReceiveMessage` method.

---

## Chapter 4: Configuring SignalR in ASP.NET Core

### Configure SignalR in Program.cs

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chatHub");

app.UseDefaultFiles();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.Run();
```

### Adding SignalR Client Library

* In your HTML client file, include SignalR client script:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/microsoft-signalr/6.0.5/signalr.min.js"></script>
```

---

## Chapter 5: Creating the Chat Client (HTML + JavaScript)

### HTML Code (chat.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Real-time Chat</title>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="text" id="user" placeholder="Enter your name">
    <input type="text" id="message" placeholder="Enter your message">
    <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>

    <div id="chat"></div>

    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/microsoft-signalr/6.0.5/signalr.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
            .withUrl("/chatHub")
            .build();

        connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) => {
            const chatDiv = document.getElementById("chat");
            chatDiv.innerHTML += `<p><strong>${user}:</strong> ${message}</p>`;
        });

        connection.start().catch(err => console.error(err.toString()));

        function sendMessage() {
            const user = document.getElementById("user").value;
            const message = document.getElementById("message").value;
            connection.invoke("SendMessage", user, message).catch(err => console.error(err));
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### How This Works:

* The client connects to the SignalR hub using WebSockets.
* When the user sends a message, it is sent to the server.
* The server broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

---

## Chapter 6: Advanced Features

### Private Messaging

* Modify the Hub to support private messaging:

```csharp
public async Task SendPrivateMessage(string connectionId, string message)
{
    await Clients.Client(connectionId).SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", "Private", message);
}
```

### Managing User Connections

* Use `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` to track connected users.

```csharp
private static Dictionary<string, string> Users = new Dictionary<string, string>();

public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()
{
    string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
    Users[connectionId] = "Anonymous";
    await base.OnConnectedAsync();
}

public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception exception)
{
    Users.Remove(Context.ConnectionId);
    await base.OnDisconnectedAsync(exception);
}
```

---

## Chapter 3: Securing SignalR with JWT Authentication

### Why Secure SignalR?

* Ensures that only authenticated users can access the chat.
* Prevents unauthorized access to real-time communication.

### Configuring JWT Authentication in Program.cs

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
    options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
    options.SaveToken = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateIssuer = true,
        ValidateAudience = true,
        ValidateLifetime = true,
        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
        ValidIssuer = "YourIssuer",
        ValidAudience = "YourAudience",
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
    };

    options.Events = new JwtBearerEvents
    {
        OnMessageReceived = context =>
        {
            var accessToken = context.Request.Query["access_token"];
            var path = context.HttpContext.Request.Path;
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(accessToken) && path.StartsWithSegments("/chatHub"))
            {
                context.Token = accessToken;
            }
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    };
});

builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
```

### Protecting the SignalR Hub

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;

[Authorize]
public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
}
```

### How This Works:

* JWT token is passed in the query string for WebSocket connections.
* SignalR hub is protected with `[Authorize]` attribute.
* Only authenticated users with valid JWT can access the chat.

---

## Chapter 4: Configuring SignalR in ASP.NET Core

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chatHub");

app.Run();
```

---

## Chapter 5: Creating the Chat Client (HTML + JavaScript)

### How to Connect with JWT Authentication

```html
<script>
const token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN";
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub?access_token=" + token)
    .build();

connection.start().catch(err => console.error(err.toString()));
</script>
```

---

## Chapter 6: Advanced Features (User Connections, Private Messaging)

* Implement private messaging and user tracking with JWT authentication.
* Use ClaimsPrincipal in the hub to identify users.

### Example

```csharp
[Authorize]
public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string message)
    {
        var username = Context.User?.Identity?.Name ?? "Anonymous";
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", username, message);
    }
}
```

---

## Chapter 7: Best Practices for Real-time Applications

* Always use HTTPS for secure connections.
* Validate JWT tokens with short expiration times.
* Use Role-based Authorization in the SignalR hub.
* Limit message size to prevent abuse.

## Phase 2: Frontend Mastery 

# Mastering React Core Concepts (Components, Props, State, Hooks)

## 1. Core Concepts (Plain English, Bullet Points)

### 1.1 Components

* **Definition:** Components are reusable pieces of UI in React.
* **Types:** Functional Components (modern) and Class Components (legacy).
* **Reusable:** Each component can be reused with different data (props).
* **Declarative:** React uses a declarative approach, meaning you describe the UI you want, and React ensures it is displayed.

### 1.2 Props (Properties)

* **Definition:** Props are read-only data passed to components.
* **Purpose:** They allow data to be passed from parent to child components.
* **Immutable:** Props cannot be changed by the receiving component.
* **Destructuring:** Use object destructuring for cleaner code.

### 1.3 State

* **Definition:** State is a data structure that holds values for a component.
* **Purpose:** State allows components to track and manage changing data.
* **Mutable:** Unlike props, state can be changed by the component.
* **State Management:** Can be local (within a component) or global (using context or external libraries).

### 1.4 Hooks

* **Definition:** Hooks are special functions in React that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components.
* **Common Hooks:**

  * `useState`: For local state management.
  * `useEffect`: For side effects (API calls, subscriptions).
  * `useContext`: For accessing context values.
  * `useReducer`: For complex state management (like Redux).

---

## 2. Detailed Code Examples (C# Style React Code)

### 2.1 Functional Component with Props Example

```jsx
import React from "react";

// Functional Component using Props
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

### 2.2 Class Component with State Example

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

// Class Component with State
class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    increment = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
                <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Counter;
```

### 2.3 Using Hooks (useState, useEffect)

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// Functional Component with Hooks
const Timer = () => {
    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup
    }, []);

    return <p>Timer: {seconds} seconds</p>;
};

export default Timer;
```

## 3. Advanced Technical Q\&A

**Q1: What is the difference between Props and State in React?**

* **Props:** Immutable, passed from parent to child.
* **State:** Mutable, managed within the component.

**Q2: How do you optimize a React component?**

* Use `React.memo` for functional components.
* Use `PureComponent` for class components.
* Use keys for list rendering.
* Avoid unnecessary re-renders using state and props correctly.

**Q3: What are React Hooks and why were they introduced?**

* Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.
* They were introduced to eliminate the need for class components and make code cleaner.

---

## 4. Take-Home Bullet Points and Best Practices

* Use functional components and Hooks for most use cases (modern React).
* Destructure props and state for cleaner code.
* Always use keys in list rendering to avoid rendering issues.
* Use `useEffect` for side effects, but always clean up effects (e.g., clear intervals).
* Avoid directly modifying state, always use setters.
* Use `React.memo` or `React.useMemo` for expensive computations.

# Mastering State Management with Redux Toolkit and React Query

## Section 1: Understanding State Management

### What is State Management?

* State management is the process of controlling and synchronizing data (state) across a React application.
* Helps maintain consistent data between UI components.
* Without state management, data sharing between components can become difficult and buggy.

### Why Redux Toolkit and React Query?

* **Redux Toolkit** provides a simplified way to manage complex application state with a clean API.
* **React Query** is used for server-state management, making API data fetching, caching, and synchronization easier.

### When to Use Redux Toolkit vs React Query

* Use **Redux Toolkit** for client-side state (UI state, local data, user preferences).
* Use **React Query** for server-side state (API data, remote data, async operations).

## Section 2: Core Concepts of Redux Toolkit

### What is Redux Toolkit?

* A modern, opinionated way of using Redux with a clean API and best practices.
* Solves boilerplate problems of traditional Redux.

### Key Components:

* **Slice:** A single piece of state and its reducers.
* **Reducer:** A pure function that manages state transitions.
* **Store:** A global state container for your application.
* **Actions:** Functions that trigger state changes.

### Sample Redux Toolkit Code (C# Style for Clarity)

```csharp
// Create a Redux Slice (C# Style)
public class CounterSlice
{
    public int Count { get; set; } = 0;

    // Increment Action
    public void Increment()
    {
        Count++;
    }

    // Decrement Action
    public void Decrement()
    {
        Count--;
    }
}

// Simulate Redux Store
var counter = new CounterSlice();
counter.Increment();
Console.WriteLine($"Count: {counter.Count}");
```

### Takeaway Points:

* Always keep state updates pure (no side effects).
* Use Redux Toolkit for scalable client-side state management.
* Organize your slices for maintainability.

## Section 3: Core Concepts of React Query

### What is React Query?

* A powerful library for managing server-side state.
* Provides built-in caching, background fetching, and automatic synchronization.

### Key Components:

* **Query:** Fetches data from an API and keeps it in sync.
* **Mutation:** Modifies server data (POST, PUT, DELETE).
* **Cache:** Stores fetched data to optimize performance.

### Sample React Query Code (C# Style for Clarity)

```csharp
// React Query Example (C# Style)
public async Task<List<string>> FetchUsersAsync()
{
    // Simulate API Call
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return new List<string> { "User1", "User2", "User3" };
}

// Use React Query with the FetchUsersAsync function
var userList = await FetchUsersAsync();
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", userList));
```

### Takeaway Points:

* Use React Query for any server-side state (data fetched from APIs).
* Avoid using React Query for UI state or client-side logic.

## Section 4: Advanced Techniques and Best Practices

* Use Redux Toolkit with the "createSlice" API for cleaner code.
* Use React Query’s "useMutation" for complex POST/PUT/DELETE operations.
* Apply caching strategies for better performance.
* Separate UI logic (React) from state logic (Redux Toolkit / React Query).

## Section 5: Advanced Technical Questions

1. What is the difference between Redux Toolkit and React Query?

   * Redux Toolkit is best for client-side state, while React Query is best for server-side state.

2. How do you optimize React Query’s caching behavior?

   * Set appropriate cacheTime and staleTime options based on API frequency.

3. What is the best way to organize slices in a large Redux application?

   * Use feature-based slices, each representing a logical part of the application.

4. How do you handle stale data in React Query?

   * Use "refetchOnWindowFocus" and "staleTime" options.

## Section 6: What to Watch Out For

* Avoid using Redux Toolkit for API calls (use React Query instead).
* Prevent state mutation (state must always be immutable).
* Use React Query’s QueryClient for complex configurations.
* Avoid nesting slices too deeply (keep your state flat).


# Modern React Master Class for Senior ASP.NET Core Developer

## Section 1: JavaScript Refresher for React

### Key JavaScript Concepts

* **Arrow Functions**

```javascript
// Traditional Function
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Arrow Function
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

* **Destructuring**

```javascript
const user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = user;
```

* **Spread and Rest Operators**

```javascript
// Spread
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const extended = [...numbers, 4, 5];

// Rest
const sum = (...args) => args.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
```

* **Async/Await**

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
};
```

## Section 2: React Core Concepts

### What is React?

* A front-end library for building interactive user interfaces.
* Component-based and uses a virtual DOM for performance.

### React Components (Functional vs Class)

* **Functional Component**

```javascript
const Greeting = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

* **Class Component**

```javascript
class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
    }
}
```

## Section 3: React Hooks (Modern Approach)

### Understanding React Hooks

* **useState**: State management for functional components.
* **useEffect**: Side-effect management (data fetching, subscriptions).
* **useContext**: Context API for global state.
* **useReducer**: Advanced state management (like Redux without Redux).
* **useRef**: Access and manipulate DOM elements without re-rendering.

### Code Examples

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Component Mounted or Updated");
    }, [count]);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Section 4: Advanced React Techniques

* **React.memo** for performance optimization.
* **React.forwardRef** for parent-to-child ref control.
* **Custom Hooks** for reusable logic.

### Advanced Code Example (React.memo)

```javascript
import React, { useState, memo } from "react";

const ExpensiveComponent = memo(({ count }) => {
    console.log("Rendering Expensive Component");
    return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
});

const App = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <ExpensiveComponent count={count} />
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Section 5: React Performance Optimization

* **Use React.memo** for preventing unnecessary re-renders.
* **Optimize Context API with useMemo and useCallback**.
* **Use React Query or SWR for data fetching (server state).**
* **Lazy Loading Components with React.lazy and Suspense.**

## Section 6: React with TypeScript

* Strongly type props and state.
* Use TypeScript interfaces for reusable types.

### TypeScript Example

```tsx
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const UserProfile: React.FC<User> = ({ name, age }) => {
    return <div>{name} is {age} years old.</div>;
};
```

## Section 7: React Router (SPA Navigation)

* **Setting Up Routes**

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => (
    <Router>
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
            <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        </Routes>
    </Router>
);
```

## Section 8: What to Watch Out For

* Avoid overusing React Context for large state management (use Redux Toolkit).
* Use React.memo for expensive components.
* Avoid inline functions in JSX (affects performance).
* Manage async state carefully with React Query or useAsync.

## Section 9: Advanced Technical Questions

1. What is the difference between React.memo and React.useMemo?
2. How do you manage performance in a large React application?
3. What are the benefits of React Query over traditional useState and useEffect for data fetching?
4. What is the difference between useRef and useState?
5. How does React Suspense work for lazy loading components?

# Mastering Angular Core Concepts (Components, Services, Modules)

## 1. Angular Components

### What is a Component?

* A **Component** is a building block of an Angular application.
* It is a class that controls a section of the user interface (UI).

### Core Parts of a Component

* **HTML Template**: Defines the UI (View).
* **CSS Styles**: Defines the look and feel.
* **Component Class (TypeScript)**: Defines logic and data handling.
* **Decorator (@Component)**: Defines metadata about the component.

### Example - Basic Angular Component

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root', // HTML tag to use this component
  templateUrl: './app.component.html', // HTML file
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] // CSS file
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Angular Core Concepts';
}
```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
```

### What to Watch Out For

* Component names must be **unique** within a module.
* Always use the `@Component` decorator for components.
* Keep the component logic simple, focusing on presentation.

## 2. Angular Services

### What is a Service?

* A **Service** is a class with a specific purpose, typically for logic and data management.
* Services promote code reusability and separation of concerns.

### Core Characteristics

* Services are injectable (using `@Injectable`).
* Typically provide data to multiple components.
* Often used with **Dependency Injection (DI)**.

### Example - Basic Angular Service

```typescript
// app.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root' // Singleton service
})
export class AppService {
  getData(): string {
    return 'Hello from Service';
  }
}
```

### What to Watch Out For

* Avoid making services handle UI logic.
* Use `providedIn: 'root'` for singleton services.
* Inject services in components using constructor injection.

## 3. Angular Modules

### What is a Module?

* A **Module** is a logical container for related components, services, directives, and pipes.
* It helps organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks.

### Core Characteristics

* Defined using the `@NgModule` decorator.
* Can be imported into other modules.
* Provides a way to bundle components and services.

### Example - Basic Angular Module

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [AppService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### What to Watch Out For

* Always declare components in a module.
* Import necessary Angular modules (e.g., BrowserModule).
* Provide services at the module level (for singleton).

## Take-Home Points

* Components focus on UI; Services focus on logic/data.
* Modules help organize code into logical blocks.
* Dependency Injection makes services reusable.

## Advanced Technical Questions

1. What is the difference between `providedIn: 'root'` and specifying a service in the `providers` array?
2. Can you explain why a service declared in one module is not available in another module?
3. How do you create a shared module, and why is it important?

## Next Steps

* Practice creating reusable components.
* Experiment with service injection in components.
* Create a shared module and use it in different feature modules.
